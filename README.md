[CloudS3](https://clouds3.playtunes.ml) is going to be an end-to-end solution to multicloud bucket storage, It is primarily being built for a single user to manage their multicloud S3 compatible buckets on cloud without a tear drop.
<br><br>
Usage of *CloudS3* can be varied from storing backups to equipping it as your personal storage service for varied Task. 
It will be more like an administrative version of S3 Buckets

# Questions on Databases
1. Why Three DBMSs?<br>
   **Three DBMSs** are being chosen to implement a safe and sound environment for the end user by providing them with instant database replication along with realtime information about data and to maintain and apply administrative access over the data. 
2. Why NoSQL and SQL DBMSs together?<br>
**NoSQL and SQL** DBMSs are chosen to give the speed and scalibility of NoSQL based database together with the reliability of SQL based database
3. Why not Apache Cassandra for NoSQL?<br>
**Apache Cassandra** is not being added by respecting the fact developer will be able to use the predefined cloud infrastructure of the above corporations and not hussle for setting up things manually. All in all we will be working a Java Based CloudS3 system as well 
4. Why PostgreSQL?<br>
**PostgreSQL** is opted as best firstly being opensourced and then it's high-compatibility with NoSQL structure(JSON Documents) along with many corporations infrastructure services allowing scalable PostgreSQL DBMS InfraStructure.

# Questions in  General 
1. Why Next.js why Not Angular?<br>
 We Chose Next.js over Angular becuase Next.js is based on React and Developers love react, Also we found Next.js to be easy develop. 
2.Why S3? Why Not VM'S Block Storage Option or Online Drives?<br>
**S3** being the most affordable option to store data in various possible conditions and due to AWS S3 API's they become an even better choice to store data than VM's or Online Drives. 
3.Does it Sync well? 
Yes, It does. For this purpose we proposed that a realtime database would be a good Idea.<br>
In Future We also look forward to Apache Kafka for Managed VM Based CloudS3.
